## What is LASIR?
[LASIR](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/LASIR) is a collaborative project&mdash;created by the Islandora Collaboration Group (ICG) and funded by nine academic institutions and Born-Digital&mdash;that is working with the [Islandora IR Interest Group](https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-IR-Interest-Group) to develop a robust suite of Institutional Repository (IR) features within Islandora to enable the platform to be competitive with the top proprietary and open-source IRs currently available. An IR is a type of digital access and preservation system that focuses on institution-generated scholarly content. LASIR will build upon existing code to further develop these key IR features:
1. Search engine optimization (SEO) and Google Scholar integration
1. Usage stats/impact factor/assessment, including system-generated visualizations of usage/content
1. Enhanced author profiles for university and college faculty members
1. A generalized and simplified self-deposit workflow
1. Facilitate the ability to contribute to larger disciplinary networks
1. Complete documentation that is accessible and thorough

## Why is LASIR Needed?
LASIR will advance Islandora’s position as a versatile, highly attractive, and affordable platform that will be a viable open-source alternative to commercial solutions. Elsevier’s recent acquisition of bepress™ is causing a wide range of academic institutions to seek an alternative non-proprietary IR platform where they can openly manage and share their scholarly output (e.g., articles, theses, and conference proceedings). For example, the University of Pennsylvania Libraries posted a public [press release](https://beprexit.wordpress.com/official-statement/) stating their termination of partnership with bepress™. The appeal of open-source IR platforms is that users can have more direct input on new feature development, alternative integrations, and future roadmap plans for their IR—an opportunity that a vendor-controlled repository system, such as Elsevier’s, does not provide. Open-source projects thrive on a vibrant community of users. By enabling Islandora as a destination for institutions seeking an open-source IR platform, LASIR seeks to enrich and add diversity to the already thriving, vibrant community of users associated with Islandora. LASIR, along with the complementary [ISLE](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE) (Islandora Enterprise) project, seeks to enhance the features of Islandora while also making it a more sustainable platform and reducing start-up costs for new users.

## Funding
- **LASIR Phase I:** $41,000 crowdfunded ($35,000 from nine academic institutions: Hamilton College, Hampshire College, Grinnell College, Middlebury College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, Vassar College, Wesleyan University, Williams College; $6,000 in-kind labor from Born-Digital); met original goal of $41,000.
- **LASIR Phase II:** Planning funding
- **LASIR Phase III:** TBD

## Project Sustainability
The LASIR Steering Committee will submit the resultant development via Islandora’s Licensed Software Acceptance Procedure ([LSAP](https://islandora.ca/developers/lsap)). The development will then become a core part of the Islandora 7x Release (Fall 2019) and will be supported and maintained by the Islandora community as part of the free and publicly shared open-source platform. Through this LSAP method, Islandora has already adopted a large number of externally contributed modules that are sustainably maintained by community members.
