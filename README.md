# LASIR: Liberal Arts Sprint for Institutional Repositories

## What is LASIR?
[LASIR](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/LASIR) is a collaborative project&mdash;initially created by the Islandora Collaboration Group (ICG) and funded by nine academic institutions and Born-Digital&mdash;that is developing a robust suite of Institutional Repository (IR) features within Islandora to enable the platform to be competitive with the top proprietary and open-source IRs currently available. An IR is a type of digital access and preservation system that focuses on institution-generated scholarly content. LASIR will build upon existing code to further develop these key IR features:
1. Search engine optimization (SEO) and Google Scholar integration
1. Usage stats/impact factor/assessment, including system-generated visualizations of usage/content
1. Enhanced author profiles for university and college faculty members
1. A generalized and simplified self-deposit workflow
1. Facilitate the ability to contribute to larger disciplinary networks
1. Complete documentation that is accessible and thorough
